TO DO:
-Make sure simulation is actually accurate✔
-Make sure x-movement works properly✔
-Have a system for outputting ball stats✔
-Have it reset the dimensions properly✔
-Have a system for setting initial conditions✔
-Have a collision detection and stop system✔
    -if pos < 0? or something else
    -calculate the exact amount of time needed to reach endpoint
    -if endpoint reached before next time set time to appropriate
    
-Change the baseline height to be so that the ball doesn't clip through walls
-Have a timer
-Have a trail that works properly
-Have ball be draggable to change its position  
-Make denote apex
-Make rulers
-Remove any imprecisions in transitioning between play and pause, between one
bit of simulation to the next
FUCK I WANNA MAKE A PRETTY TRAIL BUT FUCK I NEED TO DO OTHER SHIT
