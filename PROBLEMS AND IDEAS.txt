TO DO:
-Make sure simulation is actually accurate✔
-Make sure x-movement works properly✔
-Have a system for outputting ball stats✔
-Have it reset the dimensions properly✔
-Have a system for setting initial conditions (with setting rectangular and polar velocity)✔
-Have a collision detection and stop system✔
    -if pos < 0? or something else
    -calculate the exact amount of time needed to reach endpoint
    -if endpoint reached before next time set time to appropriate
    
-Change the baseline height to be so that the ball doesn't clip through walls✔
-Have a timer✔
-Make denote apex ??? (do i really need to do this)
-Multiple layers✔
-Make grid✔
-Have ball be draggable to change its position NO THIS IS FUCKED
-Validation for everything✔
-Remove any imprecisions in transitioning between play and pause, between one
bit of simulation to the next✔
-Have a trail that works properly✔
-GRAPHSx
-Draw velocity vectors
-Sliders to change everything
-try doing a "ball is thrown off a cliff at 15ms⁻¹ problem and fix the bullshit
