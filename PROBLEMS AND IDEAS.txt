-Acceleration is not right
-need to make version where trajectory is premodeled

TO DO:
-Make ball fall smoothly when button is clicked using the precalculated approach
-Make precalculation reset at each press of the button
-Make loop have a set time interval

IDEAS:
-At the end of every pause and measure, the velocity and position are updated to their desired positions after that
much time has elapsed
