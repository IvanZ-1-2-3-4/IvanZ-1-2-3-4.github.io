TO DO:
-Make sure simulation is actually accurate✔
-Make sure x-movement works properly✔
-Have a system for outputting ball stats✔
-Have it reset the dimensions properly✔
-Have a system for setting initial conditions (with setting rectangular and polar velocity)✔
-Have a collision detection and stop system✔
    -if pos < 0? or something else
    -calculate the exact amount of time needed to reach endpoint
    -if endpoint reached before next time set time to appropriate
    
-Change the baseline height to be so that the ball doesn't clip through walls✔
-Have a timer✔
-Make denote apex ??? (do i really need to do this)
-Multiple layers✔
-Make grid✔
-Have ball be draggable to change its position✔
-Validation for everything✔
-Remove any imprecisions in transitioning between play and pause, between one
bit of simulation to the next✔
-Have a trail that works properly✔
-Draw velocity vectors✔
-Multiple balls (for complexity)
    -Display multiple balls✔
    -Buttons to select ball✔
    -NEW layers✔
    -Change shit for individual balls✔
        -Add button for each new ball✔
    -COLOR AND SHIT✔
    -delete balls✔
    -UNLIMITED BALLS✔
    -dragging balls✔
    -timer✔
-GRAPHS
    -make the graph fit the div✔
    -make it graph over time✔
    -make sure all✔
    -LABELS DON'T WORK?????
    -make the controls make sense
    -make the controls not look like shit
    -make the graph not look like shit
-Make buttons pretty
-Remove redundant impact variable✔
-So it changes for different screen sizes
-Sliders to change everything
-try doing a "ball is thrown off a cliff at 15ms⁻¹ problem and fix the bullshit
-Don't forget to make vectors disabled by default
